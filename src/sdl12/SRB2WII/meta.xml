  <short_description>A 3D Sonic fangame</short_description>
  <long_description>Sonic Robo Blast 2 is a 3D fangame by a small group called
Sonic Team Junior, using the Doom engine as a base.
The game has been worked on for almost 11 years so far, and
it is still being very much developed today, with a huge
fanbase developing custom content, including characters,
levels, and even large-scale modifications that play out
a brand new adventure.
Based on the Doom II engine, SRB2's system requirements
are very low, even the oldest computers can play it at a
decent speed.</long_description>
